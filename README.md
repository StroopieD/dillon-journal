# Dillon's Journal – A Personal Web Journal with Style

This project is a fun experiment where I (Dillon!) built my own online journal from scratch.  
It started as a simple HTML login page and grew into a full mini-website with animations, local storage, and multiple pages.

---

##  What This Project Includes

###  **Custom Login Page**
- A simple name-based login screen that only lets *me* enter the site.
- Styled in a green-on-black “terminal” theme.

---

## **The Journal Page (home.html)**
This is where I write my thoughts.

Features:
- Auto-expanding journal text box  
- Save entries to **localStorage** so they stay even after closing the site  
- Clean layout with green-on-black styling  
- Buttons for:
  - **Save Entry**
  - **Show Old Stuff** (takes you to the entries page)
  - **Delete All Entries**

---

##  **Entries Page (entries.html)**
All previous journal entries are shown here.

Features:
- Loads past entries from the browser  
- Shows each entry with date & time  
- Button to delete all entries  
- Button to go back to the main journal page  

---

##  **Animated Stickman**
At the bottom of the page there is:
- A green-outlined animated stickman  
- Running across the screen  
- Jumping over a box  
- Looping forever  
- Pure CSS animation (no images needed)

This was added just for fun and style.

##  **Hosted with GitHub Pages**
The entire website is live using GitHub Pages.  
All files were uploaded and configured manually through GitHub’s UI.

This was my first time deploying a real website publicly!
